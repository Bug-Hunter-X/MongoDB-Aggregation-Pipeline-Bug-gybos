# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug
This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using MongoDB's aggregation pipeline. The bug involves an incorrect aggregation pipeline that leads to unexpected results.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.js` shows the corrected implementation.

## Problem
The provided aggregation pipeline is designed to group documents, count occurrences, sort by count, and limit the result set. However, due to errors in the pipeline stages (such as incorrect field names, missing stages or incorrect stage order) it does not produce the desired results.

## Solution
The corrected pipeline in `bugSolution.js` addresses the issue by ensuring the correct fields are used for grouping and sorting.  Careful attention to the order of stages and the use of appropriate aggregation operators is essential to achieve the expected results.

This example highlights the importance of thoroughly testing MongoDB aggregation pipelines to ensure they generate the desired results.
